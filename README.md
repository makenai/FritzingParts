#Fritzing Parts

![Parts](http://makenai.github.io/FritzingParts/parts.png?v=2)

This is a repository for some fritzing parts I'm working on. So far, we have:

- RedBearLab Blend Micro 1.0
- RedBearLab Bluetooth Low Energy Shield v2.1 (drawn by RedBearLab)
- SparkFun Venus GPS with SMA Connector GPS-11058

..that's it so far!
